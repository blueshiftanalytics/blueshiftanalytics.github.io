## Welcome to My Website

My name is Justin Clark and I enjoy playing around with neural networks and other A.I. frameworks. In 2016, I cofounded a quantitative hedge fund and work on developing automated trading algorithms in C++. I'm also in charge of training neural networks with [Tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org/) for prediction and modelling.

This site is the central location I'd like to keep my thoughts, ideas, favorite projects, etc.

```c++
if (developingLiveTradingAlgorithms == true or connectingToDataFarms == true){
    printf("C++ is my go to language\n");
}
```

```python
if (workingWithMachineLearning == True):
    print("I will use Python (most commonly neural networks with Tensorflow)") 
```

```matlab
if needFastPrototyping == true || backtestingTradingStrategies == true
    disp('My language of choice is Matlab');
end
```
