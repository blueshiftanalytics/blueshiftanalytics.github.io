## Welcome to my website

My name is Justin Clark and I enjoy playing around with neural networks and other A.I. frameworks. In 2016, I cofounded a quantitative hedge fund and work on developing automated trading algorithms in C++. I'm also in charge of training neural networks with [Tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org/) for prediction and modelling.

This site is the central location I'd like to keep my thoughts, ideas, favorite projects, etc.
