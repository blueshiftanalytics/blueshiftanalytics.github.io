## Welcome to my website

My name is Justin Clark and I enjoy playing around with neural networks and other machine learning frameworks. In 2016, I cofounded a quantitative hedge fund and work on developing automated trading algorithms in C++. I also work with with [Tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org/) for modelling with neural networks.

This site is the central location I'd like to keep my thoughts, ideas, favorite projects, etc.
